Study Plus by Pear

Study Plus is a flashcard based study application. There is a self study option along with a group “game” study session based off of Catch Phrase! In our prototype, we were able to create multiple functional decks that can store terms and definitions. These terms and definitions are stored via Parse. So far, we implemented our group study option. As well, we were able to implement a study session timer for the group study session.
